<div class="row new-image-page">
  <h1>New Image</h1>
  <p>All images are saved down to 800px by 800px if they are bigger than that size. This is just so the image doesn't load so big no one can see it. If you need to upload a large image for printing (like a family picture you want others to print at a high quality), please contact Beth.</p>

  <%= render 'form' %>
